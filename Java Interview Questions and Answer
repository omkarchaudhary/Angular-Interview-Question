Java:

Memory management:
1>What is the JVM Memory Structure?
The JVM memory structure is divided into several regions:
Heap: Used for dynamic memory allocation, where objects are stored.
Method Area (Permanent Generation/Metaspace): Stores class-level data such as bytecode, constants, and static variables.
Stack: Stores local variables and method calls.
PC Registers: Store the address of the currently executing instruction.
Native Method Stack: Used for native method calls.

1> Explain the concept of ‘OutOfMemoryError’ and how you would handle it.
OutOfMemoryError’ occurs when the JVM cannot allocate an object due to exhausted memory. Common causes include memory leaks, large data sets, and improper configuration. To address this error:

Analyze Heap Dumps: Use tools like VisualVM or Eclipse MAT to identify memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
Optimize Code: Ensure efficient memory usage by using appropriate data structures and minimizing unnecessary object creation.
Increase Heap Size: Adjust JVM heap size parameters to allocate more memory.
Garbage Collection Tuning: Improve memory management by tuning garbage collector settings.

2>How would you monitor and profile memory usage in a Java application?
Monitoring and profiling memory usage in Java applications can be done using:

VisualVM: Provides detailed memory usage information, including heap dumps and garbage collection statistics.
JConsole: Monitors memory usage, tracks memory pools, and observes garbage collection activity in real-time.
Java Mission Control (JMC): Offers advanced profiling and diagnostics, including flight recording and memory analysis.
Heap Dumps: Snapshots of memory at a specific time, analyzed with tools like VisualVM or Eclipse MAT.
Garbage Collection Logs: Provide insights into GC activity, helping in tuning GC parameters.

3>How does the JVM optimize memory allocation for short-lived objects or How Generational Garbage Collection Works?
The JVM optimizes memory allocation for short-lived objects through generational garbage collection. The heap is divided into generations: Young, Old, and Permanent (or Metaspace). New objects are allocated in the Young Generation’s Eden Space, which is collected frequently. Surviving objects move to Survivor Spaces and eventually to the Old Generation if they persist. This approach efficiently manages memory by focusing on the Young Generation, where most short-lived objects reside.

4> What is Memory Leak in Java and How to Avoid It?
A memory leak occurs when objects that are no longer needed are not released because there are still active references to them. This can eventually lead to OutOfMemoryError.

Example of a Memory Leak:
List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();
while (true) {
    list.add(new Object());  // Objects are continuously added but never removed
}
Prevention:
Avoid holding unnecessary object references.
Use memory profiling tools (like VisualVM) to identify leaks.
Nullify references once they are no longer needed.

5> How Do You Trigger Garbage Collection from Java Code?
You, as Java programmer, can not force garbage collection in Java; it will only trigger if JVM thinks it needs a garbage collection based on Java heap size.

Before removing an object from memory garbage collection thread invokes finalize()method of that object and gives an opportunity to perform any sort of cleanup required. You can also invoke this method of an object code, however, there is no guarantee that garbage collection will occur when you call this method.

Additionally, there are methods like System.gc() and Runtime.gc() which is used to send request of Garbage collection to JVM but it’s not guaranteed that garbage collection will happen.

String:
3>How Is a String Stored in Memory
String literals are stored in a runtime constant pool, which is allocated from the JVM’s method area.

Although the method area is logically part of the heap memory, the specification does not dictate the location, memory size, or garbage collection policies. It can be implementation-specific.

3> What is String Constant Pool and how it works?
The string pool, also known as the String constant pool or the String intern pool, is a special memory region where the JVM stores String instances.
It optimizes application performance by reducing how often and how many strings are allocated:

The JVM stores only one copy of a particular String in the pool
When creating a new String, the JVM searches in the pool for a String having the same value
If found, the JVM returns the reference to that String without allocating any additional memory
If not found, then the JVM adds it to the pool (interns it) and returns its reference

4> What does String's intern() method do or What is the significance of the intern() method?
The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap and stores it in the String constant pool, which the JVM maintains.
Java automatically interns all strings created using string literals, but if we create a String using the new operator, for example, String str = new String(“abc”), then Java adds it to the heap, just like any other object.

We can call the intern() method to tell the JVM to add it to the string pool if it doesn’t already exist there, and return a reference of that interned string:

5>Why Is It Safer to Store Passwords in a Char[] Array Rather Than a String?
Since strings are immutable, they don’t allow modification. This behavior keeps us from overwriting, modifying, or zeroing out its contents, making Strings unsuitable for storing sensitive information.
We have to rely on the garbage collector to remove a string’s contents. 

By using a char[] array, we have complete control over that information. We can modify it or wipe it completely without even relying on the garbage collector.

6>Difference Between String, Stringbuffer and Stringbuilder?
Strings are immutable. This means that if we try to change or alter its values, then Java creates an absolutely new String. 
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer in Java create objects that hold a mutable sequence of characters. StringBuffer is synchronized and therefore thread-safe whereas StringBuilder is not.

Since the extra synchronization in StringBuffer is typically unnecessary, we can often get a performance boost by selecting StringBuilder.

7>What Are the Benefits of Strings Being Immutable?
strings are immutable to improve performance and security.

And actually, we see several benefits to having immutable strings:

The string pool is only possible if the strings, once created, are never changed, as they are supposed to be reused
The code can safely pass a string to another method, knowing that it can’t be altered by that method
Immutably automatically makes this class thread-safe
Since this class is thread-safe, there is no need to synchronize common data, which in turn improves performance
Since they are guaranteed to not change, their hashcode can be easily cached

8>Why String is a popular HashMap key in Java?
Since String is immutable, its hashcode is cached at the time of creation and it doesn’t need to be calculated again. This makes it a great candidate for keys in a Map and its processing is fast than other HashMap key objects. This is why String is mostly used Object as HashMap keys.

Exception:
1>What Is the Purpose of the Throw and Throws Keywords?
The throws keyword is used to specify that a method may raise an exception during its execution. It enforces explicit exception handling when calling a method:

public void simpleMethod() throws Exception {
    // ...
}
Copy
The throw keyword allows us to throw an exception object to interrupt the normal flow of the program. This is most commonly used when a program fails to satisfy a given condition:

if (task.isTooComplicated()) {
    throw new TooComplicatedException("The task is too complicated");
}
Note: if the exceptions have an inheritance relationship; the child type must come first and the parent type later. If we fail to do this, it will result in a compilation error

2>What Is the Difference Between a Checked and an Unchecked Exception?
A checked exception must be handled within a try-catch block or declared in a throws clause; whereas an unchecked exception is not required to be handled nor declared.

Checked and unchecked exceptions are also known as compile-time and runtime exceptions respectively.

All exceptions are checked exceptions, except those indicated by Error, RuntimeException, and their subclasses.

3>What Is Exception Chaining?
Occurs when an exception is thrown in response to another exception. This allows us to discover the complete history of our raised problem:

try {
    task.readConfigFile();
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
    throw new TaskException("Could not perform task", ex);
}

4>What Is a Stacktrace and How Does It Relate to an Exception?
A stack trace provides the names of the classes and methods that were called, from the start of the application to the point an exception occurred.

It’s a very useful debugging tool since it enables us to determine exactly where the exception was thrown in the application and the original causes that led to it.

5>What Are the Rules We Need to Follow When Overriding a Method That Throws an Exception?
When the parent class method doesn’t throw any exceptions, the child class method can’t throw any checked exception, but it may throw any unchecked.

Here’s an example code to demonstrate this:

class Parent {
    void doSomething() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void doSomething() throws IllegalArgumentException {
        // ...
    }
}

The next example will fail to compile since the overriding method throws a checked exception not declared in the overridden method:

class Parent {
    void doSomething() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void doSomething() throws IOException {
        // Compilation error
    }
}
When the parent class method throws one or more checked exceptions, the child class method can throw any unchecked exception; all, none or a subset of the declared checked exceptions, and even a greater number of these as long as they have the same scope or narrower.

6>How to write custom exceptions in Java?
We can extend Exception class or any of its subclasses to create our custom exception class. The custom exception class can have its own variables and methods that we can use to pass error codes or other exception-related information to the exception handler. A simple example of a custom exception is shown below.

7>What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?
final and finally are keywords in java whereas finalize is a method. final keyword can be used with class variables so that they can’t be reassigned, with the class to avoid extending by classes and with methods to avoid overriding by subclasses, finally keyword is used with try-catch block to provide statements that will always get executed even if some exception arises, usually finally is used to close resources. finalize() method is executed by Garbage Collector before the object is destroyed, it’s a great way to make sure all the global resources are closed. Out of the three, only finally is related to java exception handling.

8>Provide some Java Exception Handling Best Practices?
Some of the best practices related to Java Exception Handling are:
Avoid NullPointerExceptions by returning Boolean instead of null.
Don’t use empty catch blocks; they create problems. Instead, use print stack trace or another command. 
Always log exception messages for debugging purposes.
Use multi-catch block for cleaner close.
Use custom exceptions to throw a single type of exception from your application API.
Follow naming convention, always end with Exception.


Collection:

1>How Is Hashmap Implemented in Java? How Does Its Implementation Use Hashcode and Equals Methods of Objects? What Is the Time Complexity of Putting and Getting an Element from Such Structure?
The HashMap class represents a typical hash map data structure with certain design choices.

HashMap stores key-value pair in `Map.Entry` static nested class implementation. HashMap works on hashing algorithm and uses hashCode() and equals() method in `put` and `get` methods. When we call `put` method by passing key-value pair, HashMap uses Key hashCode() with hashing to find out the index to store the key-value pair. The Entry is stored in the LinkedList, so if there is an already existing entry, it uses equals() method to check if the passed key already exists, if yes it overwrites the value else it creates a new entry and stores this key-value Entry. When we call `get` method by passing Key, again it uses the hashCode() to find the index in the array and then use equals() method to find the correct Entry and return its value. The below image will explain these detail clearly.The other important things to know about HashMap are capacity, load factor, threshold resizing. HashMap initial default capacity is **16** and load factor is 0.75. The threshold is capacity multiplied by load factor and whenever we try to add an entry if map size is greater than the threshold, HashMap rehashes the contents of the map into a new array with a larger capacity. The capacity is always the power of 2, so if you know that you need to store a large number of key-value pairs, for example in caching data from the database, it's a good idea to initialize the HashMap with correct capacity and load factor.


2>Explain the internal working of HashSet in Java
HashSet in Java internally uses HashMap to store elements. It can also store unique values with no duplicate values.

In Java, HashSet developer can have add(E e) method that takes just the element to add as a parameter. It does not accept the key and value pair.

1> What is the difference between Hashmap and Hashtable?
Hashmap	Hashtable
It is not synchronized.	It is synchronized.
HashMap allows one key as a null value.	HashTable does not allow null values.
Iterator is used to traverse HashMap.	Either Iterator or Enumerator is used for traversing a HashTable.
It can be used for both HashTable, HashMap and is fail-fast.	It can be used with HashTable and is fail-safe.
HashMap perform faster than the HashTable.	Hashtable is not much faster as compared to HashMap.

2> What Is the Difference Between Fail-Fast and Fail-Safe Iterators?
Iterators for different collections are either fail-fast or fail-safe, depending on how they react to concurrent modifications. The concurrent modification is not only a modification of collection from another thread but also modification from the same thread but using another iterator or modifying the collection directly.

Fail-fast iterators (those returned by HashMap, ArrayList, and other non-thread-safe collections) iterate over the collection’s internal data structure, and they throw ConcurrentModificationException as soon as they detect a concurrent modification.

Fail-safe iterators (returned by thread-safe collections such as ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) create a copy of the structure they iterate upon. They guarantee safety from concurrent modifications. Their drawbacks include excessive memory consumption and iteration over possibly out-of-date data in case the collection was modified.


4> Differentiate between ArrayList and LinkedList
The difference between ArrayList and LinkedList is:

ArrayList	LinkedList
It uses a dynamic array.	It uses a doubly-linked list.
ArrayList is not preferable for manipulation.	LinkedList is preferable for manipulation.
ArrayList provides random access.	LinkedList does not provide random access.
ArrayList s stores only objects hence it takes less overhead of memory	LinkedList stores object as well as address object; hence, it takes more overhead of memory.


5> Comparable and Comparator Interface
Comparable and Comparator interfaces are used to sort collection or array of objects. Comparable interface is used to provide the natural sorting of objects and we can use it to provide sorting based on single logic (compareTo()). Comparator interface is used to provide different algorithms for sorting and we can choose the comparator we want to use to sort the given collection of objects (compare).

6> Can we use any class as Map key?
We can use any class as Map Key, however following points should be considered before using them.
-   If the class overrides equals() method, it should also override hashCode() method.
-   The class should follow the rules associated with equals() and hashCode() for all instances. Please refer earlier question for these rules.
-   If a class field is not used in equals(), you should not use it in hashCode() method.
-   Best practice for user defined key class is to make it immutable, so that hashCode() value can be cached for fast performance. Also immutable classes make sure that hashCode() and equals() will not change in future that will solve any issue with mutability. For example, let's say I have a class `MyKey` that I am using for the HashMap key.
    
    ```
    //MyKey name argument passed is used for equals() and hashCode()
    MyKey key = new MyKey("Pankaj"); //assume hashCode=1234
    myHashMap.put(key, "Value");
    
    // Below code will change the key hashCode() and equals()
    // but its location is not changed.
    key.setName("Amit"); //assume new hashCode=7890
    
    //below will return null because HashMap will try to look for key
    //in the same index as it was stored but since the key is mutated, 
    //there will be no match and it will return null.
    myHashMap.get(new MyKey("Pankaj")); 
    ```
    
    This is the reason why String and Integer are mostly used as HashMap keys.

7> How to avoid ConcurrentModificationException while iterating a collection?
We can use concurrent collection classes to avoid `ConcurrentModificationException` while iterating over a collection, for example CopyOnWriteArrayList instead of ArrayList. Check this post for [ConcurrentHashMap Example](/community/tutorials/concurrenthashmap-in-java).


MultiThreading:

1> Can we call run() method of a Thread class?
Yes, we can call run() method of a Thread class but then it will behave like a normal method. To actually execute it in a Thread, we need to start it using **Thread.start()** method.

2> How can we make sure main() is the last thread to finish in Java Program?
We can use Thread join() method to make sure all the threads created by the program is dead before finishing the main function. Here is an article about [Thread join method](/community/tutorials/java-thread-join-example)

3> How does thread communicate with each other?
When threads share resources, communication between Threads is important to coordinate their efforts. Object class wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods allows threads to communicate about the lock status of a resource. Check this post to learn more about [thread wait, notify and notifyAll](/community/tutorials/java-thread-wait-notify-and-notifyall-example).

4> Why thread communication methods wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are in Object class?
In Java every Object has a monitor and wait, notify methods are used to wait for the Object monitor or to notify other threads that Object monitor is free now. There is no monitor on threads in java and synchronization can be used with any Object, that's why it's part of Object class so that every class in java has these essential methods for inter thread communication.

5>Why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods have to be called from synchronized method or block?
When a Thread calls wait() on any Object, it must have the monitor on the Object that it will leave and goes in wait state until any other thread call notify() on this Object. Similarly when a thread calls notify() on any Object, it leaves the monitor on the Object and other waiting threads can get the monitor on the Object. Since all these methods require Thread to have the Object monitor, that can be achieved only by synchronization, they need to be called from synchronized method or block.

6> How do you ensure thread safety in Java?
Answer: Thread safety can be ensured using several mechanisms:

Synchronization: Using synchronized methods or blocks to control access to shared resources.
Locks: Using explicit locks like ReentrantLock to manage thread access.
Atomic variables: Using classes from the java.util.concurrent.atomic package for atomic operations.
Thread confinement: Confining objects to a single thread to ensure they are not accessed concurrently.
Immutable objects: Using immutable objects that cannot be modified after creation.

7> What are the different ways to achieve synchronization in Java?
Answer:

Synchronized methods: Declaring methods with the synchronized keyword.
Synchronized blocks: Using synchronized blocks within methods.
Explicit locks: Using Lock and ReentrantLock classes.
Volatile keyword: Using the volatile keyword for variables that are shared between threads.
Atomic variables: Using classes from the java.util.concurrent.atomic package.


8> What is a thread pool? How can you create a thread pool in Java?
Answer: A thread pool is a managed collection of worker threads that are reused to perform multiple tasks. It helps improve performance by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads.

You can create a thread pool using the Executors class:

9> What is the role of volatile keyword in Java concurrency?
volatile keyword in Java is used to ensure that changes made to a variable are visible to all threads.
When a variable is declared as volatile, the Java Memory Model (JMM) ensures that the changes are propagated to all threads.

10> How do you use Lock interface and its implementations (ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock) in Java?
The Lock interface is a part of the Java concurrency API that provides a more flexible and powerful way of locking compared to the synchronized keyword.
ReentrantLock and ReadWriteLock are two implementations of the Lock interface.
the ReentrantLock is used to protect the shared resource.
The lock() method is used to acquire the lock, and the unlock() method is used to release the lock.

ReadWriteLock is used to protect the shared resource.
The readLock() method is used to acquire a read lock, and the writeLock() method is used to acquire a write lock.

11> How do you use Executor framework to execute tasks concurrently in Java?
The Executor framework in Java provides a way to execute tasks concurrently using a thread pool.
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
Runnable task1 = new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Task 1 executed");
  }
};
Runnable task2 = new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Task 2 executed");
  }
};
executor.execute(task1);
executor.execute(task2);
executor.shutdown();

Java8/11/17 Features:
1. What are the features that are introduced in Java 8?
Java 8 introduced a number of major features that transformed the way Java programs are written, including:

Lambda Expressions: Offers a straightforward and succinct method to express a single abstract method interface through an expression.
Stream API: Enables functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.
Optional Class: Introduced to avoid null pointer exceptions and handle values that may or may not be present.
Default and Static Methods in Interfaces: Allows interfaces to have methods with implementations, making it easier to evolve interfaces without breaking the implementation.
Method References: Provides a shorthand notation for a lambda expression that calls an existing method.
New Date and Time API: A new java.time package was introduced to deal with date and time in a more intuitive and thread-safe manner.
Nashorn JavaScript Engine: A new engine to execute JavaScript code within Java applications.
2. What is a Lambda Expression, and why is it important in Java 8?
A Lambda Expression in Java 8 is essentially an anonymous function that allows you to write more concise code, especially in scenarios where small functional behavior needs to be passed. It eliminates the need for creating anonymous inner classes and makes code more readable and less cluttered.

Example:

// Before Java 8
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running...");
    }
};

// Using Lambda Expression in Java 8
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Running...");
Lambda expressions are important as they enable functional programming in Java, making it easier to express operations like iterating over collections and working with streams.

3. What is the Stream API, and how does it work in Java 8?
The Stream API is one of the most powerful features of Java 8. It allows developers to process collections of objects in a functional manner. A stream is a sequence of elements from a source (e.g., collection, array) that supports aggregate operations. The Stream API works on a lazy execution model, meaning operations are only performed when terminal operations (like collect(), forEach()) are invoked.

Example:

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack", "Doe");

// Using stream to filter and collect names
List<String> result = names.stream()
                           .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
In the above example, we filter the names starting with “J” and collect them in a list using the Stream API. The API encourages immutability and thread safety due to its functional nature.

4. Explain the concept of Functional Interfaces in Java 8.
Which interface has only one abstract method is known as a functional interface. We can annotate with @FunctionalInterface annotation to mark interfaces designed to be functional. These are critical for using lambda expressions, as lambdas can be treated as instances of functional interfaces.

Example:

@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void execute();
}
Java provides many built-in functional interfaces such as Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and newly added ones like Function, Predicate, Supplier, and Consumer.

5. What is the significance of the Optional class in Java 8?
The Optional class in Java 8 was introduced to deal with null values in a safer way and avoid NullPointerException. It is an object that holds a value, which can either be present or absent. Instead of returning null, methods can return an Optional to indicate the presence or absence of a value.

Example:

Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(getName());

// Check if a value is present
if (optional.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println(optional.get());
} else {
    System.out.println("Name is not available");
}
The Optional class provides methods like isPresent(), ifPresent(), orElse(), and orElseThrow() to handle values in a more controlled manner.

6. What are Default Methods in interfaces, and why were they introduced in Java 8?
Default methods are methods within interfaces that come with a pre-defined implementation. An interface can have only abstract methods but it was before Java 8. Now with default methods, interfaces can be extended without forcing changes to existing implementations, ensuring backward compatibility. If a class implements an interface, it automatically inherits default methods unless it chooses to override them.

Example:

public interface Vehicle {
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.start();  // Output: Vehicle is starting...
    }
}
This feature provides backward compatibility, allowing new methods to be added to interfaces without forcing all implementing classes to modify their code.

7. How Does Java 8 Manage Date and Time with the New API?
Java 8 introduced an improved Date and Time API, located in the java.time package, which is more intuitive and feature-rich compared to the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. This new API is both immutable and thread-safe.

Key classes include:

ZonedDateTime: Represents a full date-time with a specific time zone.

LocalDate: Represents a date (year, month, day) without any time zone information.

LocalTime: Represents a time (hours, minutes, seconds) without a date.

LocalDateTime: Combines both date and time without a time zone.

Example:

LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
LocalDate birthday = LocalDate.of(1990, Month.JANUARY, 1);
System.out.println("Today's date: " + today);
This modern API simplifies date and time manipulation, making it more readable and practical compared to the older approaches.

8. What Are Method References in Java 8?
Java 8 introduced Method References, a feature that allows referencing methods of classes or objects using the :: operator. This feature simplifies the syntax of lambda expressions by allowing you to directly refer to existing methods.

There are four types of method references:

Constructor Reference: Class::new

Static Method Reference: Class::staticMethod

Instance Method Reference of a Specific Object: object::instanceMethod

Instance Method Reference of Any Object of a Class: Class::instanceMethod

Example:

// Using Lambda Expression
list.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));

// Using Method Reference
list.forEach(System.out::println);
In this example, System.out::println is a shorthand version of the lambda expression s -> System.out.println(s).

9. What Benefits Does the Stream API Provide in Java 8?
The Stream API in Java 8 brings significant benefits for processing data more efficiently and expressively:

Declarative Programming: Stream API allows you to describe data processing tasks in a clear, functional style, avoiding the verbosity of imperative code.
Concurrent Processing: Streams can efficiently utilize multi-core processors, allowing developers to easily perform operations on large datasets in parallel.
Parallel Processing: It takes advantage of multi-core processors, allowing parallel execution of tasks for better performance on large datasets.
Lazy Evaluation: Operations on streams are performed lazily, meaning they only execute when needed, leading to performance gains by skipping unnecessary computations.
Method Chaining: Streams support method chaining, resulting in cleaner, more readable code.
Example:

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(2, 1, 3, 8, 5, 10, 7, 4, 9, 6);

// Using Stream API to filter even numbers, square them, and collect the results
List<Integer> squaredEvenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                          .filter(num -> num % 2 == 0)
                                          .map(num -> num * num)
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(squaredEvenNumbers); // Output: [4, 64, 100, 16, 36]
This example shows how the Stream API allows concise, fluent operations to filter, map, and collect data.

11> Which situation is most suitable for using stream API in Java 8?
For executing lazy operations
To perform database operations
Use for internal iterations.
For writing functional-style programming
You can use it for using pipeline operations.

12> Why is the peek () method used in Java 8?
The peek() method helps support debugging, where one wants to notice the elements as they tend to flow from a specific point in a pipeline. It is a representation of our observation of how each element passes

13> What are static methods in Interfaces?
Static methods, which contain method implementation are owned by the interface and are invoked using the name of the interface, it is suitable for defining the utility methods and cannot be overridden.

Spring Framework:
1> What Are the Benefits of Using Spring?
Lightweight – There is a slight overhead of using the framework in development.
Inversion of Control (IoC) – Spring container takes care of wiring dependencies of various objects instead of creating or looking for dependent objects.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) – Spring supports AOP to separate business logic from system services.
IoC container – manages Spring Bean life cycle and project-specific configurations
MVC framework – used to create web applications or RESTful web services, capable of returning XML/JSON responses
Transaction management – reduces the amount of boilerplate code in JDBC operations, file uploading, etc., either by using Java annotations or by Spring Bean XML configuration file
Exception Handling – Spring provides a convenient API for translating technology-specific exceptions into unchecked exceptions.

1> What Is Dependency Injection and How Can We Inject Beans in Spring?
Dependency injection, an aspect of Inversion of Control (IoC), is a general concept stating that we do not create our objects manually but instead describe how they should be created. Then an IoC container will instantiate required classes if needed.
 
A few different options exist in order to inject Spring beans:

Setter injection
Constructor injection
Field injection
The configuration can be done using XML files or annotations.

3> Which Is the Best Way of Injecting Beans and Why?
The recommended approach is to use constructor arguments for mandatory dependencies and setters for optional ones. This is because constructor injection allows injecting values to immutable fields and makes testing easier.

4> How to Define the Scope of a Bean?
In order to set Spring Bean’s scope, we can use @Scope annotation or “scope” attribute in XML configuration files. Note that there are five supported scopes:

Singleton
Prototype
Request
Session
Global-session

5> Are Singleton Beans Thread-Safe?
No, singleton beans are not thread-safe, as thread safety is about execution, whereas the singleton is a design pattern focusing on creation. Thread safety depends only on the bean implementation itself.

6> How to Enable Transactions in Spring and What Are Their Benefits?
There are two distinct ways to configure Transactions — with annotations or by using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) — each with their advantages.

Here are the benefits of using Spring Transactions, according to the official docs:

7> what is AOP and What Are Aspect, Advice, Pointcut and JoinPoint in AOP?
Aspects enable the modularization of cross-cutting concerns such as transaction management that span multiple types and objects by adding extra behavior to already existing code without modifying affected classes.
Aspect – a class that implements cross-cutting concerns, such as transaction management
Advice – the methods that get executed when a specific JoinPoint with matching Pointcut is reached in the application
Pointcut – a set of regular expressions that are matched with JoinPoint to determine whether Advice needs to be executed or not
JoinPoint – a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception

Spring Boot:
1> What Is Spring Boot and What Are Its Main Features?
Spring Boot is essentially a framework for rapid application development built on top of the Spring Framework. With its auto-configuration and embedded application server support, combined with the extensive documentation and community support it enjoys, Spring Boot is one of the most popular technologies in the Java ecosystem as of date.
Here are a few salient features:

Starters – a set of dependency descriptors to include relevant dependencies at a go
Auto-configuration – a way to automatically configure an application based on the dependencies present on the classpath
Actuator – to get production-ready features such as monitoring
Security – to provide authentication and authorization
Logging – to record events at certain points during program execution


2>How to Tell an Auto-Configuration to Back Away When a Bean Exists?
To instruct an auto-configuration class to back off when a bean already exists, we can use the @ConditionalOnMissingBean annotation.

The most noticeable attributes of this annotation are:

value – the types of beans to be checked
name – the names of beans to be checked
When placed on a method adorned with @Bean, the target type defaults to the method’s return type

3> How to Deploy Spring Boot Web Applications as Jar and War Files?
Traditionally, we package a web application as a WAR file and then deploy it into an external server. Doing this allows us to arrange multiple applications on the same server. When CPU and memory were scarce, this was a great way to save resources.

But things have changed. Computer hardware is fairly cheap now, and the attention has turned to server configuration. A small mistake in configuring the server during deployment may lead to catastrophic consequences.

Spring tackles this problem by providing a plugin, namely spring-boot-maven-plugin, to package a web application as an executable JAR.

To include this plugin, just add a plugin element to pom.xml:

<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>
With this plugin in place, we’ll get a fat JAR after executing the package phase. This JAR contains all the necessary dependencies, including an embedded server. So, we no longer need to worry about configuring an external server.

We can then run the application just like we would an ordinary executable JAR.

Notice that the packaging element in the pom.xml file must be set to jar to build a JAR file:

<packaging>jar</packaging>
If we don’t include this element, it also defaults to jar.

11> How Do You Handle Database Management and Data Consistency in a Microservices Architecture?
Within a Microservices architecture, it is common for each service to maintain its own dedicated database.

To maintain data consistency, strategies like the Saga pattern event-driven architecture can be employed to ensure that data updates across multiple services are atomic and consistent.

12> How Would You Define a Distributed Transaction?
In the context of Microservices, a Distributed Transaction refers to a transaction that involves multiple Microservices. Each Microservice independently performs its part of the transaction while maintaining data consistency across the system. 

Coordinating mechanisms like the Saga pattern can be used to ensure the overall consistency of the transaction. 

The goal is to either successfully commit changes across all Microservices or rollback the transaction if any part fails, ensuring data integrity within the distributed environment of Microservices.

13> What Are the Best Practices for Monitoring and Observability in a Microservices Environment?
Best practices for monitoring and observability in a microservices environment include implementing centralized logging, distributed tracing, and metrics collection.

14> How Can You Achieve Fault Tolerance and Resilience in Microservices?
Here are some key practices and approaches to enhance fault tolerance and resilience:

Redundancy and replication: Run multiple instances of each microservice for backup and availability.
Circuit breaker pattern: Detect and handle service failures to prevent cascading failures.
Bulkhead pattern: Isolate failures within limited scopes to contain their impact.
Timeout and retry strategies: Set timeouts and implement retries for transient failures.
Failure monitoring and alerting: Monitor system health, log errors, and set up alerts for critical failures.
Health checks and self-healing: Implement health checks and automated recovery mechanisms.

15> How Do You Handle Distributed Transactions Across Multiple Microservices?
Distributed transactions in microservices can be handled by employing patterns like the Saga pattern.

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions in microservices by breaking them into smaller localized transactions called "saga steps." Microservices perform their own local transactions and emit events to trigger the next step. If a step fails, compensating actions are taken to undo previous changes.

Two types of Sagas exist:

Choreography-based: Microservices communicate directly through events, coordinating the saga through decentralized communication.
Orchestration-based: A central coordinator controls the transaction flow, communicating with microservices to execute steps and handle compensating actions.

16> How Do Microservices Communicate With Each Other?
This is also one of the frequently asked Microservices interview questions.

Here are the common approaches for inter-service communication in microservices:

HTTP/REST: Microservices communicate through HTTP endpoints using RESTful APIs.
Messaging/event-driven: Asynchronous communication via message brokers or event-driven architectures.
RPC (remote procedure call): Invoking methods or procedures on remote services.
Message queues: Services exchange messages via message queues or brokers.
Service mesh: Infrastructure layer for managing communication, service discovery, and load balancing.
Shared database: Microservices communicate indirectly by sharing a common database.

17> What Are Some Common Microservices Patterns?
This question stands out as a crucial topic within the realm of Microservices interview questions. Several microservices patterns are commonly used in architecture design. Here are a few examples:

API gateway pattern: Provides a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices, handling routing, authentication, and monitoring.
Circuit breaker pattern: Handles failures and prevents cascading failures by monitoring service availability and redirecting requests to a fallback mechanism when necessary.
Saga pattern: Manages long-running, distributed transactions by breaking them down into smaller, compensating transactions across multiple services.
Event sourcing pattern: Captures all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events, allowing for reliable audit logs and flexible querying.
Command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Pattern: Separates read and write operations, enabling optimized read operations and handling complex data requirements.
Bulkhead pattern: Divides microservices into separate pools of resources to prevent failures in one service from impacting others.
Retry pattern: Automatically retries failed requests or operations with increasing delays to handle transient failures in communication.

18> How Do You Ensure Data Consistency in a Microservices Architecture?
Maintaining data consistency across microservices can be challenging. Two common approaches are:

Saga pattern: Use a saga to coordinate a sequence of local transactions across multiple services. If one operation fails, compensating actions are performed to roll back the changes.
Eventual consistency: Accept that there may be temporary inconsistencies between services and rely on background processes or event-driven mechanisms to synchronize and resolve conflicts over time.
